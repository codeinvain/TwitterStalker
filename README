TwitterStalk.in is a website allowing you to arrow down on a twitter follower.
Implemented a' la Google search interface where you can write one or more twitter user handles in the search box (seperated by coma) 
and display the followers intersection as a result.
The website is implemented in ruby and utilizes twitter and redis API. 
a live demo is at http://www.twitterstalk.in 

Original implementation was developed by 
@rauchy @unativ and @danielissimo in 'ruby underground' user group hackathon #1
